Several judges submit scores as part of a competition.
It is known that some judges tend to score highly, and some tend to score lower.
Therefore, the organizers of the competition came up with a specific scoring formula.
This formula is described below and your task is to implement it.
</p>
<p>
Given a sequence of scores given by the judges, we will call the highest third of them (rounded down if necessary) the "high scores", the lowest third (again, rounded down if necessary) the "low scores", and all the other scores are called "middle scores".
We then take an average (i.e., mean) high score, an average low score, and an average middle score.
The final score is then computed as the sum of those three values.
</p>
<p>Given the vector &lt;int&gt; <b>individualScores</b> containing individual scores submitted by the judges, return the final score.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>ScoringJudges</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>overallScore</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>vector &lt;int&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>double</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>double overallScore(vector &lt;int&gt; individualScores)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Limits</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Time limit (s):</td><td>2.000</td></tr><tr><td>Memory limit (MB):</td><td>256</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Notes</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>If multiple judges submit the same score, it is possible that different groups of scores will contain individual scores with the same value.
